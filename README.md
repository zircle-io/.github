## Purpose
ðŸ¥‡ Let's be clear. Our purpose is to fix what's broken by listening to the people (including ourselves) and create a space that we the people want. A space where we feel safe, when connecting, communicating and contributing. 

We do not aim to make this is a rip-off big-tech, such as Meta, to just copy and paste their platforms. On the other hand, it would be absolutely stupid not taking inspiration from what already has worked. Our aim is not to reinvent the wheel - we just want to change course and fix the leaks.
