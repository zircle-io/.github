## Purpose
ðŸ¥‡ Let's be clear. This is not a rip-off big-tech, such as Meta, to just copy and paste their platforms. Our purpose is to fix what's broken by listening to the people (including ourselves) and create a space that we the people want. A space where we feel safe, when connecting, communicating and contributing.
