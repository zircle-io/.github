## Purpose
ðŸ¥‡ Let's be clear. Our purpose is to fix what's broken by listening to the people (including ourselves) and create a space that we the people want. A space where we feel safe, when connecting, communicating and contributing. 

We do not aim to make this is a rip-off big-tech, such as Meta, and just copy and paste their platforms. On the other hand, it would be absolutely stupid not taking inspiration from what already has worked. Our aim is not to reinvent the wheel - we just want to change course and fix the leaks. 

## Issues at hand

### Coordinated bots sharing fake news to manipulate real people
Elon Musk said it well, when he acquired Twitter (now X): "~20% of users are bots". If the status quo is that the platforms allow bots to create, share and manipulate society, then we have a serious threat to democrazy. Simultanously, this issue is contradictory for the platforms where it happens â€“ which currently does not exclude anyone â€“ because:

**1. First of all**, the business model depends on user engagement, which can be demonstrated to advertisers paying for this reach and engagement. This yields a result, which does not align with the interest in descaling bots interacting with content, beacuse it shows performance to advertisers, who *love* to see high reach. 

**2. Secondly**, the only real incentive is to "make the platform safe for the users", but the users have no real way of impacting (other than reporting) that something does not comply with community guidelines. But in the end, the algorithm works on ocassionally finding content which you disagree with to stipulate a reaction, so the engagement increases. 

Looking at these reasons, adding the undeniable fact that these platforms demonstrate to have a significant impact on mental health, elections, freedom of speech and reliance in terms of communicating with people you care about, there is no discussion that it is time to make a difference. Because (unfortunately), there is no incentive for these platforms to solve this, by requiring verification for all users, yet it is clear it is the solution to avoid this form of manipulation. 

### Old protocols does not match the security standards of the 21st century 
The SMTP protocol in e-mail is a good example of an ancient technology, which unfortunately is easily turned to advantage a swindlers purpose of cheating money by orchestrating a sequence of events to capture ones payment information by the use of fake emails, texts and calls. 

In the digital world, it is relatively easy to get started and a lot of people are tricked by psychology and especially fear to act now and get taken advantage of.

A scenario like this is possible due to the openess enabling the same service by various providers, i.e. in e-mail with Google Gmail and Microsoft Outlook. But on the other hand this is also the reason why spoofing and other techniques are possible. The security measures are low, because it is open and anyone can integrate with it, leaving flaws which decent tech-savvy frauds can utilize to take advantage of people less capable.

### AI voices are indistinguishable from real people
Continuing down the path above, it is fair to add the context that in both cases, and a lot of other unmentioned scenarios, it is possible to utilize deep fake videos, voices and imagery to craft propaganda or act in conversations to take advangtage of other people, by connecting it to the already insecure standards, this is how an astoninshing amount of people are scammed everyday. 

## Fake accounts can be created in a matter of seconds 
Imagine buying something on Facebook Marketplace, only to realize that the person you just transferred a sum of money to was a scammer. You'll never see the money again, and you will never recieve the product. This is happening far too often. Contemplate about how often these are accounts are acting in their real name - not so often, right?
